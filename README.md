### Hi there, I'm Nando ðŸ‘‹
I'm 21 and I intend to start my career as a Full Stack Developer. Currently studying Computer Science at [UTFPR](http://www.utfpr.edu.br) and a Full-Stack-Deveper bootcamp at [Driven Education](https://www.driven.com.br), I feel empowered to join a team and offer good results.
